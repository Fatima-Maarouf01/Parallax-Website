            <p>In this presentation we'll be explaining AI and chat GPT. We'll also mention how
                AI evolved and what will become of it in the future, as well as the impact that
                AI will have in various fields such as education, transportation and healthcare</p>

            <h1>What is AI</h1>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is simply granting machines the ability to simulate human
                Intelligance and allowing these machines to perform tasks that no ordinary computer
                can do, tasks that require a high level of intelligance and are only achieved via learning</p>

            <h1>How does AI work</h1>
            <p>By Implementing machine learning algorithms on neural networks (structured
                similar to our brains) we can allow the computer to learn new information, and
                acheive new results all on its own. Then the computer will be able to decide
                which actions are favorable and which are not. You can see a type of a neural network
                to the right!</p>

            <h1>Examples of AI</h1>
            <p>Multiple AI projects are available. From self driving cars to online chatbots
                and actual robots like Sophia. We also have AI than can fully generate Music! However
                the innovation of the decade is chat GPT, a language model that you can chat with. It can
                do anything from solving equations to writing code, and even writing poetry!</p>

            <h1>Is AI a Threat</h1>
            <p>The vast improvements that AI is witnessing is causing a considerable amount of
                panic among people. Questions about AI replacing humans in many work fields, leaving
                millions unemployed are being asked. The impact on the market is inevitable, some people
                will loose their jobs to AI, but on the other hand this change in the market will provide
                a ton of new job opportunities!</p>
