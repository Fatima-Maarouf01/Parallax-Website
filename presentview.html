        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundFirst">Medical Treatments and Vaccine Research</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">In the past, the process of researching, creating, and promoting vaccinations typically took years, if not decades. Artificial intelligence alters all of that, despite perhaps not being as apparent to the general public. In just a few months last year, medical research facilities and health organizations used AI to develop vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected us all globally. In fact, only three months after the initial cases were recorded, the first human experiments for these vaccines began.
            Finding effective treatments came next. Additionally, in 2021, scientists and researchers from the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science began using AI to try and reuse currently available medications to combat COVID-19.</p>

        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundSecond">Language Processing</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">Translation services, text interpretation and categorization, speech recognition, and even the power to run chatbots are now available thanks to language processing and conversation interfaces.
            The usage of AI has probably advanced most clearly in the way we communicate with voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. Also, even though we may not always observe it in action, many people engage with chatbots on a variety of services provided by different businesses or institutions.
            Modern virtual assistants no longer provide straightforward, predetermined responses to our frequently repeated questions. Some people are now starting to identify things like intent or sentiment and respond accordingly by changing how they communicate in writing or verbally, thanks to advances in AI and human language processing.</p>

        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundThird">Image and Video Processing</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">AI-powered image and video processing and creation are now widely used and have no longer been restricted. It's utilized in a wide variety of situations, from relatively straightforward tasks like changing the background of video conferences performed using Microsoft Teams or Zoom to more intricate and occasionally unsettling creations known as deepfakes. Additionally, in countries like China, where video surveillance and facial recognition are already widely utilized, AI image processing has become commonplace in 2021.</p>

        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundThird">Autonomous Driving</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">Artificial intelligence-powered fully autonomous driving is gradually making its way onto our roadways. Experts have frequently promised tremendous improvement over the past few years, but these expectations have not come true. Besides the complexity of the causes, it is pretty obvious that the planning and decision-making required by AI must overcome some extremely challenging issues, particularly with regard to safety measures. Nonetheless, certain places conduct regular testing of self-driving vehicles.</p>

            <p class="texts">OpenAI created ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a chatbot that went live in November 2022. It has been improved (a method of transfer learning) by utilizing both supervised and reinforcement learning strategies. It is based on the OpenAI GPT-3 family of big language models. On November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was introduced as a prototype. It soon gained popularity for its thorough responses and clear responses in a variety of subject areas.</p>

            <p class="texts">On top of GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), was fine-tuned using supervised learning and reinforcement learning (a method of transfer learning).  Both strategies made use of human trainers to enhance the performance of the model. During supervised learning, the trainers acted as both the user and the AI assistant in dialogues that were given to the model. Human trainers ranked the model's responses that it had produced in a previous conversation as the first phase in the reinforcement learning process. These rankings were used to produce "reward models," on which the model was further improved by a number of Proximal Policy Optimization iterations (PPO).</p>

            <ul class="texts">
                <li>ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging</li>
                <li>ChatGPT is sensitive to tweaks to the input phrasing or attempting the same prompt multiple times. For example, given one phrasing of a question, the model can claim to not know the answer, but given a slight rephrase, can answer correctly.</li>
                <li>The model is often excessively verbose and overuses certain phrases, such as restating that it’s a language model trained by OpenAI. These issues arise from biases in the training data</li>
                <li>While efforts were done to make the model refuse inappropriate requests, it will sometimes respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behavior. Moderation API is used to warn or block certain types of unsafe content, but it is expected to have some false negatives and positives for now.</li>
