        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundFirst">Medical Treatments and Vaccine Research</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">In the past, the process of researching, creating, and promoting vaccinations typically took years, if not decades. Artificial intelligence alters all of that, despite perhaps not being as apparent to the general public. In just a few months last year, medical research facilities and health organizations used AI to develop vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected us all globally. In fact, only three months after the initial cases were recorded, the first human experiments for these vaccines began.
            Finding effective treatments came next. Additionally, in 2021, scientists and researchers from the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science began using AI to try and reuse currently available medications to combat COVID-19.</p>

        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundSecond">Language Processing</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">Translation services, text interpretation and categorization, speech recognition, and even the power to run chatbots are now available thanks to language processing and conversation interfaces.
            The usage of AI has probably advanced most clearly in the way we communicate with voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. Also, even though we may not always observe it in action, many people engage with chatbots on a variety of services provided by different businesses or institutions.
            Modern virtual assistants no longer provide straightforward, predetermined responses to our frequently repeated questions. Some people are now starting to identify things like intent or sentiment and respond accordingly by changing how they communicate in writing or verbally, thanks to advances in AI and human language processing.</p>
