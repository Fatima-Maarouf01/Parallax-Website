        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundFirst">Medical Treatments and Vaccine Research</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">In the past, the process of researching, creating, and promoting vaccinations typically took years, if not decades. Artificial intelligence alters all of that, despite perhaps not being as apparent to the general public. In just a few months last year, medical research facilities and health organizations used AI to develop vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected us all globally. In fact, only three months after the initial cases were recorded, the first human experiments for these vaccines began.
            Finding effective treatments came next. Additionally, in 2021, scientists and researchers from the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science began using AI to try and reuse currently available medications to combat COVID-19.</p>

        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundSecond">Language Processing</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">Translation services, text interpretation and categorization, speech recognition, and even the power to run chatbots are now available thanks to language processing and conversation interfaces.
            The usage of AI has probably advanced most clearly in the way we communicate with voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. Also, even though we may not always observe it in action, many people engage with chatbots on a variety of services provided by different businesses or institutions.
            Modern virtual assistants no longer provide straightforward, predetermined responses to our frequently repeated questions. Some people are now starting to identify things like intent or sentiment and respond accordingly by changing how they communicate in writing or verbally, thanks to advances in AI and human language processing.</p>

        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundThird">Image and Video Processing</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">AI-powered image and video processing and creation are now widely used and have no longer been restricted. It's utilized in a wide variety of situations, from relatively straightforward tasks like changing the background of video conferences performed using Microsoft Teams or Zoom to more intricate and occasionally unsettling creations known as deepfakes. Additionally, in countries like China, where video surveillance and facial recognition are already widely utilized, AI image processing has become commonplace in 2021.</p>

        <h3 class="titleTextsRoundThird">Autonomous Driving</h3>
        <p class="textsRound">Artificial intelligence-powered fully autonomous driving is gradually making its way onto our roadways. Experts have frequently promised tremendous improvement over the past few years, but these expectations have not come true. Besides the complexity of the causes, it is pretty obvious that the planning and decision-making required by AI must overcome some extremely challenging issues, particularly with regard to safety measures. Nonetheless, certain places conduct regular testing of self-driving vehicles.</p>
