        <p class="textsRound">In the past, the process of researching, creating, and promoting vaccinations typically took years, if not decades. Artificial intelligence alters all of that, despite perhaps not being as apparent to the general public. In just a few months last year, medical research facilities and health organizations used AI to develop vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected us all globally. In fact, only three months after the initial cases were recorded, the first human experiments for these vaccines began.
            Finding effective treatments came next. Additionally, in 2021, scientists and researchers from the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science began using AI to try and reuse currently available medications to combat COVID-19.</p>
